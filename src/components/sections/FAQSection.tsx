    question: "How are leads verified?",
    answer:
      "Every lead goes through our dual verification process. First, our AI system validates phone numbers, email addresses, and checks for duplicate entries. Then, our human verification team makes a discovery call to confirm buying intent, budget range, and property preferences. Only leads that pass both stages are delivered to you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes Zyero Lead different from other lead gen agencies?",
    answer:
      "Unlike traditional agencies that focus on volume, we prioritize quality. Our verification rate is 94%+, meaning you only pay for leads that are genuine buyers. We also offer appointment booking services, CRM integration, and a dedicated account manager on Growth and Enterprise plans.",
  },
  {
    question: "What locations do you target?",
    answer:
      "We currently operate in all major Indian cities including Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi NCR, Kolkata, and Ahmedabad. For Enterprise clients, we can expand to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities as well.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast do we start receiving leads?",
    answer:
      "Once your campaign is set up (typically 2-3 business days), you can expect to receive your first leads within 24-48 hours. Lead flow stabilizes within the first week as our targeting algorithms optimize for your specific property type.",
  },
  {
    question: "What information do you capture for each lead?",
    answer:
      "Each verified lead includes: Full name, verified phone number, email address, preferred property type (1BHK/2BHK/3BHK/Villa/Plot), budget range, preferred location, timeline to purchase, and any specific requirements mentioned during verification.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you integrate with our existing CRM?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We integrate with all major CRMs including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho CRM, and custom solutions. Leads are automatically pushed to your CRM in real-time, with all verification details included. API access is available for Enterprise clients.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is your refund policy for unqualified leads?",
    answer:
      "We stand behind our verification process. If a lead turns out to be fake, unreachable after 3 attempts, or clearly uninterested, we replace it at no extra cost. Simply flag the lead in your dashboard, and our team will review and credit your account.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I pause or cancel my subscription?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can pause your subscription at any time for up to 30 days. Cancellations require 7 days notice before your next billing cycle. There are no long-term contracts — we earn your business every month.",
